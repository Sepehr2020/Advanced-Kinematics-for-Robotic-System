This repository includes projects for "Advanced Kinematics for Robotic System" course.

There are two main parts, individual and group projects. 
The individual projects were focused on a 6-DOF serial manipulator, while the group project 3-RRR planar parallel manipulator.

For more information, read "Course_Project".

Note: For individual projects, project 1 is not included and only projects 2, 3 and 4 are posted in part 1, part 2 and part 3 folders, respectively, because the first one was only the simple SolidWORKS design. 



Course Description: 
Introduction to kinematics of robot manipulators (serial and parallel). Serial: Forward and inverse kinematics for manipulators with spherical and non-spherical wrists. Parallel: Loop-closure equations and methods for solving polynomial systems. Trajectory generation: Joint and Cartesian spaces. Jacobians, velocity and static force analyses, singularities (kinematic, static and architectural). Introduction to dynamics.
